<h2>What is eye-tracking? (1.5 hours)</h2>

<p class="centercol"><a href="index.html">&crarr; Back to module homepage</a></p>

<p class="centercol">Eye-tracking is a technique that has many uses. In this module we&#39;ll talk about two of them. First, though, we need to see what eye-tracking actually is. Do the activities below to learn about what the eye-tracking method is.</p>

<center><button class="collapsible">Limitations of self-paced reading</button>

<div class="content">
<p>You have already learned about one way we can study how people read in the module on Sentence Comprehension: <strong>self-paced reading</strong>.</p>

<p>Think about how a self-paced reading experiment works. (If you don&#39;t remember, you can go back to the &quot;Sentence Comprehension&quot; module and do the self-paced reading garden path experiment again.) Then answer the following two questions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Describe what a self-paced reading experiment is&mdash;how it works, and what it measures.</li>
	<li>Can you think of any reasons why results from a self-paced reading experiment might not be realistic, or might not be a good measure of how people naturally read? e.g., are there any important differences between how natural reading works and how self-paced reading works?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">What eye-tracking is</button>

<div class="content">
<p>Here are a couple potential problems with self-paced reading that I could think of:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Button-pressing is unnatural. In normal reading in real life, you don&#39;t have to press a button to read each next word. When you do self-paced reading, maybe the act of constantly pressing the button distracts you a little bit and changes the way you read.</li>
	<li>No backtracking. When you read normally in real life, you can look back and re-read things (for example, maybe you read a few sentences and then realize you hadn&#39;t fully understood something from earlier, so you look back to read it again). But in the self-paced reading experiment we did, there&#39;s no way to go back; once you click the button and go to the next word, the previous words are gone.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are two possibly important ways that self-paced reading is different than regular reading. There are probably other important differences, too; did you think of any other ones that I didn&#39;t mention here?</p>

<p>In any case, because of these issues, you might be skeptical about self-paced reading: do results from self-paced reading experiments really teach us about how normal reading happens?</p>

<p>One way to address that question is to use <em><strong>eye-tracking</strong></em>. Eye-tracking is a special method that uses some special software and a special camera to figure out where people are looking on a screen. In an eye-tracking experiment, you show the whole sentence on the screen (instead of showing one word at a time like you do in self-paced reading) and let a person read it. While the person reads it, a camera (usually just under the screen, or on a special hat that a person wears to hold a camera near their eye) records the person&#39;s eyeball. Using math (especially trigonometry&mdash;because the space between the screen, the camera, and the person&#39;s eye makes a triangle) the camera can figure out what place on the screen the person&#39;s eyes are looking at. Using this, the eye-tracker can figure out how long a person takes to read each word.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, there are two kinds of eye-tracking cameras: cameras that sit on the table usually below the screen (these are sometimes called &quot;remote&quot; eye-trackers), and cameras that a person wears on a special kind of hat (these are sometimes called &quot;head-mounted&quot; eye-trackers). Search online (using Google Images or something similar) and find a picture of what a remote eye-tracker looks like and a picture of what a head-mounted eye-tracker looks like.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">What are eye movements like?</button>

<div class="content">
<p>To get a sense for how people&#39;s eyes move when they are reading, watch three brief videos on YouTube:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://youtu.be/VYDwYoMtFcE?t=7s" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eye movements</a> -- this is what the camera &quot;sees&quot; when it records someone&#39;s eyes while they are reading</li>
	<li><a href="https://youtu.be/VFIZDZwdf-0?t=31s%20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eye-tracking demo #1</a> -- this shows where someone&#39;s eyes are looking while he is reading. The person reading just sees the screen with the text; he doesn&#39;t see the blue dot. The blue dot was added to this video later using data from the eye-tracker. The blue dot shows where the person was looking.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndQm26ztZpo&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eye-tracking demo #2</a> -- this is similar to the demo #1 above, it shows where someone&#39;s eyes were looking while they were reading. This one shows it with a red line instead of a blue dot, but it&#39;s the same idea.</li>
</ul>

<p>After having watched those, please describe how people&#39;s eyes move when they read. Some things you can address in your description:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Do people&#39;s eyes move smoothly across the page, or is the movement kind of jumpy?</li>
	<li>Do people&#39;s eyes always move forward (from one word to the next word)?</li>
	<li>Do people&#39;s eyes stop to read every word?</li>
	<li>Is there anything that surprised you about the way people&#39;s eyes move (anything that you didn&#39;t expect, or that was different from what you previously thought)?</li>
</ul>
