		<h2>The linguistic relativity debate (7 hours)</h2>

		<h4 class="centercol">Module overview</h4>
		<p class="centercol">Lots of people believe there is some kind of special link between language and thought. This idea is hotly
			debated; the goal of this module is for you to understand this debate, so that you can make a well-informed judgment
			and response when you see people claiming that differences between languages are related to differences between
			cultures or thinking patterns. By the end of the module, you should be able to do the following things:</p>
		<ul class="center">
			<li>Recognize when a linguistic relativity claim is being made;</li>
			<li>Categorize different kinds of claims about linguistic relativity;</li>
			<li>Explain evidence for and against linguistic relativity.</li>
			<li>Explain how psycholinguistic techniques have been used to test linguistic relativity.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 class="centercol">Module instructions</h4>
		<p class="centercol">This module includes three tasks. For each task, you will need to read something and then
			answer some questions; some of these questions may require a long time to think about. These tasks are meant to
			be done in order (i.e., the intention is for you to not start one task until you have done the previous task; when
			this was taught via an LMS the later modules would be "locked" until the student completed the previous ones). To
			receive credit for completing this module, you must complete all the tasks at a satisfactory level of quality.</p>
		<p class="centercol">Next to each task I have written an estimate of how much time you might need to complete the
			task. This is, of course, a rough estimate, and the real time may be different for different students.</p>
