<h2>Do the experiment! (6-10 hours)</h2>

<p class="centercol"><a href="index.html">&crarr; Back to module homepage</a></p>

<p class="centercol">Find volunteers to participate in your experiment. You should get <strong>at least 6 volunteers</strong>, and they should be people who are not familiar with priming (i.e., people who are not in this class and have not studied psycholinguistics before). Scoring for this part will be as follows:</p>

<ul class="center">
	<li><em>If you are working on your own</em>, <strong>1 pt per participan</strong>t (up to 10 pts)</li>
	<li><em>If you are working with a partner,</em> <strong>0.5 pt per participant</strong> (up to 10 pts; 20 participants)</li>
</ul>

<p class="centercol">In some cases, your participants may be harder to find (for example, if you&#39;re testing learners of Japanese). You should still try to find as many as you can, but if you find it&#39;s difficult, you can send me an email and we can discuss how to handle that.</p>

<p class="centercol">When you do the experiment, there are two ways you can choose to organize your data. Remember that DMDX automatically creates a .azk file with your results in it, and the .azk file it creates always has the same name as your experiment (.rtf) file. If there are already results from one participant, and then you run another participant on the same computer, DMDX will add the next participant&#39;s results at the bottom of the .azk file. So, one option for your data organization is, you can keep all participants in that same file. Another option is to keep them in separate files: after you run the experiment once, you change the name of the .azk file (I like to name it something like &quot;participant001.azk&quot;, &quot;participant002.azk&quot;, etc.). That way, when you run the experiment again, DMDX will create a new .azk file for the new results, without modifying the old file whose name you have changed. Either approach (keeping all participants in one file, or separating them into their own file) is fine; it&#39;s your choice. (I personally find the second one easier to deal with.)</p>

<p class="centercol">If you&#39;re using Psychopy, you will also want to think about how to organize your results, and make sure you don&#39;t accidentally erase anything. Usually this is as simple as making sure each participant has a different ID when you run the experiment, but you&#39;ll still want to test it out before you get your real participants.</p>

<p class="centercol">When you&#39;ve finished collecting your data, you should analyze it and send me a <em>very short </em>report of your results. This just needs to contain overall averages of conditions, and then averages for each participant. For example:</p>

<ul class="center">
	<li class="centercol">Overall average accuracy and response time for targets in the related condition and the unrelated condition</li>
	<li class="centercol">The same information but for each participant (you can just call them P01, P02, P03... or something like that)</li>
</ul>

<p class="centercol">You can present it as a document, or in an Excel file. (Note: please just send me ONE document/Excel file reporting the results.)</p>

<p class="centercol">Once I&#39;ve received that, I&#39;ll let you know what to do next.</p>
