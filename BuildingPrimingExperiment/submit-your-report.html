<h2>Submit your report (5 hours)</h2>

<p class="centercol"><a href="index.html">&crarr; Back to module homepage</a></p>

<p class="centercol">Prepare and submit the following items:</p>

<ul class="center">
	<li>Your un-edited data (one or more .azk files, or the results file(s) from Psychopy)</li>
	<li>Your DMDX script/scripts or Psychopy experiment (You may have sent this before, but please send it again here, because it&#39;s possible you might have made changes before running the final version of the experiment)</li>
	<li>A report describing your experiment and your findings. The report can be in any format, as long as it clearly addresses the key questions (see below). Usually most people submit their report as a written essay, but other formats are also possible (for example, poster, slide show, or video presentation). While there are no specific format requirements, your report must address the following questions:
	<ul>
		<li>What was your experiment design? i.e., what type of priming did you test, using what paradigm and what task?</li>
		<li>What were your predictions? What pattern of data did you expect to see? (Often the easiest way to clearly describe your predictions is to draw a graph of the expected data pattern.)</li>
		<li>What were your experiment methods? i.e., you should tell me, in detail, the following things:
		<ul>
			<li>how many participants you used</li>
			<li>what criteria the participants met (e.g. how old they were, what their language background was, etc.)</li>
			<li>how many words you used</li>
			<li>what kinds of words you chose (e.g. were there certain kinds of words you tried to avoid? or certain kinds of words that you always used? did you try to make sure that you had equal numbers of one kind of word and another kind of word? etc.)</li>
			<li>what decisions you made about how to present the experiment (for example, how long was the time between primes and targets? if there was a mask, how long was it presented for? did you randomize the order of stimuli for participants?)</li>
			<li>how you analyzed the data</li>
		</ul>
		In cases where you made choices about how to do the experiment or how to analyze the data, you should justify those choices. Your description of the experiment methods should be as clear as possible; the purpose of a &quot;methods&quot; description is so that if somebody in the future wanted to run an experiment replicating your experiment, they should be able to know exactly what you did so that they can arrange an exactly identical experiment and see if they get the same results pattern as you. If any part of the methods is not clear enough, I will ask you to revise and resubmit your report.</li>
		<li>What were your results? You should use a clear graph or table to illustrate the findings. Your graph should clearly show how the pattern varies (or does not vary) across participants. And your results must be accurate (i.e., if I analyze your data, I should be able to get the same results).</li>
		<li>What is your conclusion? Based on the data you found, did the results match your predictions, or not, or is it unclear? Justify your conclusion.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="centercol">Overall, if you present a clear report that includes all the pieces described above, you will get 20/20 pts. The actual grade will depend a lot on the quality of how you organize and present the information.</p>

<p class="centercol">You are welcome to refer to other studies or resources you used to design and complete your project (if you do, make sure to provide proper references in a consistent style such as APA6). However, there is no requirement to cite other sources and you will not automatically gain extra points by doing so.</p>

<p class="centercol">When you are sure you&#39;re ready, you can submit your final report (along with the DMDX/Psychopy items listed above) to me via Blackboard using the &#39;Project Report&#39; assignment.</p>

<p class="centercol">Once you&#39;ve submitted the report, you have finished this project. <strong>Congratulations!</strong></p>
