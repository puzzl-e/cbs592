<h2>Top-down vs. bottom-up processing (<em>completed in class</em>)</h2>

<p class="centercol"><a href="index.html">&crarr; Back to module homepage</a></p>

<p class="centercol">Another important distinction in psychology is the difference between <strong>bottom-up</strong> and <strong>top-down</strong> ways of understanding things.</p>

<p class="centercol">Bottom-up processing is when you understand some stimulus (something you see, something you hear, something you taste, etc.) based on its actual properties. For example, I see something, it&#39;s furry, it has four legs, it has a cute face, it has whiskers, I can tell that it&#39;s a cat.</p>

<p class="centercol">Top-down processing is when you understand some stimulus based on the context and your expectations. For example, I&#39;m visiting the home of my friend who I know is a cat lover, and I heard some meowing sounds, so I already strongly expect that there&#39;s a cat here. Then, if I see something (even if I don&#39;t see it very clearly), I can probably already guess that it&#39;s a cat.</p>

<p class="centercol">Top-down information can have a pretty strong impact on how you understand and react to things; context matters. Here&#39;s an example that&#39;s happened to me before (&#39;me&#39; in this section is Stephen Politzer-Ahles). Do you ever go to sleep with a cup or bottle of water sitting near you? When I was in college I ran in the cross-country team, and I often had lots of bottles of water and bottles of Gatorade (or similar sports drink) sitting around. Sometimes I would wake up in the middle of the night and reach for a bottle of water to drink. Sometimes I accidentally grabbed a Gatorade instead, in the dark. And if I took a drink of that, expecting water, it would taste so shocking and gross. Has that ever happened to you?</p>

<p class="centercol">Actually I love Gatorade. If I drank it under any other circumstance, it would taste good. But when I was expecting water and then suddenly I taste that very different taste, it&#39;s really weird. This shows how top-down expectations can influence the way we respond to a bottom-up stimulus.</p>

<h4 class="centercol">Top-down/bottom-up processing and language</h4>

<p class="centercol">How do we understand language? When you hear a person talking, what information can you use to understand the words they are saying?</p>

<p class="centercol">There are a lot of types of information available to us. Here are several:</p>

<p class="centercol"></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Discourse context</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Sentence structure</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Words</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Sounds</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<p class="centercol">By <em>sounds</em>, I just mean the physical properties of the sounds you hear. You know what a &quot;k&quot; sounds like, you know what an &quot;s&quot; sounds like, etc. When you&#39;re hearing a sound, you might notice all the physical details of the sound, and then you might recognize, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s an <em>m</em>!&quot; If you hear enough sounds together you might recognize each of them (&quot;That&#39;s an <em>m</em>! Hey, that next sound is an <em>ɐ</em>! And next I just heard a <em>n</em>!&quot;) and you might be able to put them together (&quot;That was the word 蚊 [mɐn]!&quot;). That would be a completely bottom-up way of understanding: you are building up from the low-level information (the specific sounds) to figure out the next higher level of information (what word those sounds make).</p>

<p class="centercol">By <em>words</em>, I mean your knowledge of the words in the language. Imagine I hear someone say a word <em>?esk</em>. The person&#39;s voice was not clear, and the background was noisy, so I couldn&#39;t clearly hear if the first sound was a <em>t</em> or a <em>d</em>. But if we&#39;re speaking English, I might be able to figure out what they were saying. I might realize that <em>desk</em> is a real word in English, and <em>tesk</em> is not. So I might conclude that my friend said <em>desk</em>, even though I didn&#39;t clearly hear the bottom-up information (the exact sounds). This is an example of a way I can use some top-down, higher-level information (my knowledge about what words exist in my language) to fill in gaps that I didn&#39;t hear from the bottom-up information.</p>

<p class="centercol">By <em>sentence structure</em>, I mean your knowledge of how sentences work in your language. For example, imagine you hear someone say <em>You need to ?ush the door</em>. Maybe you didn&#39;t clearly hear whether the person said <em>push</em> or <em>bush</em>. And, <em>push</em> and <em>bush</em> are both real words in English, so you can&#39;t use your word knowledge to fill in the gap. But you&#39;re good at English, and you know that the phrase &quot;You need to...&quot; must have a verb after it. You also know that <em>push</em> is a verb, and <em>bush</em> is not a verb. So you can use this top-down information to figure out that the person must have said <em>push</em>. (Instead of syntax structure, you could also rely on meaning and/or frequency of patterns in your experience: &quot;push the door&quot; makes sense and is probably a phrase you have heard before, whereas &quot;bush the door&quot; doesn&#39;t really mean anything and is probably not something you&#39;ve ever heard.)</p>

<p class="centercol">Finally, by <em>discourse context</em>, I mean everything else about the context of the conversation. For example, if I said the incomplete sentence &quot;<em>Since we&#39;re in Hong Kong, most people&#39;s native language is...</em>&quot;, you probably already know what the next word is going to be (based on your knowledge of Hong Kong), without needing to wait to hear me say it.</p>

<p class="centercol">This illustrates that there are many ways top-down information can be used to help you understand language. (In fact, top-down information can do more than fill in gaps; you can even predict what people are going to say before they say it. You&#39;ve probably seen or heard examples where one person finishes someone else&#39;s sentence. This could not happen without top-down information!)</p>

<p class="centercol">Here are some slides that demonstrate situations where top-down information changes the way you read. Can you figure out what the top-down information is, and how it is changing your reading? <a href="top-down.ppt">top-down.ppt</a></p>

<p class="centercol"></p>

<p class="centercol">To finish this activity, write a brief argument explaining which mechanism you think is more important in language processing: the top-down mechanism, or the bottom-up mechanism. Why do you think that one is more important? (Or if you think the answer is more complicated than just one or the other, explain why.)</p>
