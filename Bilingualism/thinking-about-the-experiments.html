<h2>Thinking about the experiment (1 hour)</h2>

<p class="centercol"><a href="index.html">&crarr; Back to module homepage</a></p>

<p class="centercol">Both of the mini-experiments you did were <b>priming</b> experiments.  </p>

<center><button class="collapsible">For the first experiment, did you notice what type of <i>presentation</i> it used? (click for answer)</i></button>
<div class="content">
<p class="centercol"> The first experiment used <b>masked priming</b>. <i>Did the masking work? Or did you see some of the primes? If you saw some of the primes, did you notice anything about how they were related to the targets?</i> </p>
</div>
</center>

<center><button class="collapsible">Click for example stimuli</button>
<div class="content">

<p class="centercol"> If you saw the primes, maybe you could guess what the experiment was about. If you didn’t see the primes, here are some examples of the related primes and targets from this experiment:

<div class="content">
<p class="centercol">  The best answer is that it is about <b>phonological form</b>.</p>

<p class="centercol"> In bilingualism research, these types of words are called <b>interlingual homophones</b>. Homophones are words that sound the same. Typically we think of examples in a single language, like ‘I’ and ‘eye’ or ‘sum’ and ‘some’ in English. They sound the same, but have different meanings. In Cantonese or Mandarin, you have a lot of these (e.g., 是 and 事). </p>

<p class="centercol"> An <i>interlingual</i> homophone is the same thing, but instead of being in the same language, it's in different languages (<i>inter-</i> means "between" or "among", e.g., <i>international</i> = 'between nations'). You probalby know about the the international phonetic alphabet (IPA) that linguists use to represent the sounds of languages. Using IPA we would write the sound of Mandarin “米” as /mi/, and English “me” would also be written /mi/. So, these look like they would be interlingual homophones. </p>

<p class="centercol"> Note that the stimuli for this experiment wouldn’t work for Cantonese-English bilinguals, because for them the Chinese words are not always pronounced similarly to the English targets. For example, “米” in Jyutping is <i>mai5</i>, so more like English ‘my’. </p>

</div>
</center>

<center><button class="collapsible"> But, maybe, you’ve already thought of a pretty important difference between “米” and “me”? (click for the answer)</button>
<div class="content">

<p class="centercol"> TONES. It’s actually almost impossible for Mandarin words and English words to be perfect homophones because almost every Mandarin word has to have a tone. If we include the tones, then '米' and 'me' are slightly different: /mi3/ vs /mi/ (where the 3 indicates Mandarin Tone 3). Because these are perfect homophones, maybe we can call them interlingual <i>near</i>-homophones, that is, they are nearly homophones, but not quite. </p>

<p class="centercol">The purpose of the little experiment you completed was to test whether this type of near-homophone would affect how quickly you recognized the English words.</p>

<p class="centercol"> In class, we’ll take a look and see what the results were, but even before we see the results, we can start to think about what they might mean. Here’s one possible outcome: we find that Mandarin-English bilinguals were faster to recognize English words that had a related word (an interlingual near-homophone) as the prime.</p> 

<center>
  <img src="prediction1.png"

</center>

<p class="centercol">  Why would that happen? One explanation would be that, whenever you activate 米 in Mandarin, you are simultaneously activating all (near) homophones in any languages you know. So 米 /mi3/ would activate words like 眯 /mi3/ and maybe even 蜜 /mi4/ in Mandarin, but also the English word ‘me’ /mi/. We could claim this is evidence that, for bilinguals, both of their languages are simultaneously active. </p>

<center>
  <img src="non-selective.png"
  width = "200"/>
</center>

<p class="centercol"> It's like all the words in the mental network are connected, without any difference between L1 and L2. So, when an L1 word is activated, that activation spreads both to L1 words <i>and</i> to L2 words.</p>

<p class="centercol">This gets at one of the major theoretical debates that has been going on for decades in bilingualism: are the different languages a bilingual person knows separated in their mind or are they together? The typical name for the first theory is <b>language selective</b>, that is, whenever a bilingual uses language, they always just select one of the languages and not the other. The name for the opposite theory is <b>language non-selective</b>, suggesting that whenever a bilingual uses a language, both of their languages are activated. </p>

<p class="centercol">These are pretty simplistic ways to describe the theories, and over decades of research, there are a lot important details that have been identified and studied. For now, however, we’ll just assume it’s a simple choice between ‘selective’ and ‘non-selective’ theories. In this simple view of things, we would say that any experiments that show bilinguals activating both languages simultaneously would be evidence for the non-selective theory, while any experiments show people only activating one language and not the other, would be evidence for the selective theory.</p>

<p class="centercol"><b>So, in thinking about the first experiment you did, do you think results will show that activation of interlingual homophones is selective or non-selective? Why?</b></p>

<p class="centercol">When you have finished these activities, and any other tasks described on Blackboard, you are ready for class.</p>
