<h2>Complete two experiments (15 minutes)</h2>

<p class="centercol"><a href="index.html">&crarr; Back to module homepage</a></p>

<p class="centercol">Your first task is to complete two experiments online. The links for the experiments are below. You should complete them in order. These are online experiments and sometimes there will be technical problems. If an experiment isn't working,  the first thing to do is try a different browser. Chrome and Safari work best. If the experiment still isn't working, you can wait a few hours and try again (sometimes the website is undergoing maintenance). If it still isn't working, you can email me and let me know. </p>

<center><button class="collapsible">Experiment 1</button>
<div class="content">
<p class="centercol"> This experiment can be completed by anyone who knows English. <i>You may want to open the link by right-clicking, otherwise it will take you away from this page.</i></p>
<p class="centercol"> <a href=https://farm.pcibex.net/p/OiCLVO/> Experiment 1 </a> </p>
</div>
</center>

<center><button class="collapsible">Experiment 2</button>
<div class="content">

<p class="centercol"> This experiment can only really be completed if you can read Chinese, but you can try it even if you don't know Chinese. You can do it using either a Traditional Chinese version, or aSimplified Chinese version, just choose the version that uses the type of Chinese characters you are most comfortable reading. <i>You may want to open the link by right-clicking, otherwise it will take you away from this page</i>.</p>
<p class="centercol"> <a href=https://farm.pcibex.net/p/REsHlv/> Experiment 2 (traditional characters)</a> </p>
<p class="centercol"> <a href=https://farm.pcibex.net/p/fkRCbm/> Experiment 2 (simplified characters)</a> </p>
</div>
</center>

<center><button class="collapsible">After you finish the experiments, click here.</button>
<div class="content">
<p class="centercol"> After you complete the experiments, write down any notes or observations you have about them. Especially see if you can remember any of the stimuli. Can you figure out how the words were related? What was different about Experiment 1 and Experiment 2?</p>
</div>
</center>


<p class="centercol">When you have finished these activities, continue to the next section of the module: &quot;<a href="thinking-about-the-experiments.html">Thinking about the experiments</a>&quot;.</p>
