<h2>Complete two experiments (15 minutes)</h2>

<p class="centercol"><a href="index.html">&crarr; Back to module homepage</a></p>

<p class="centercol">Your first task is to complete two experiments online. The links for the experiments are below. You should complete them in order. </p>

<center><button class="collapsible">Experiment 1</button>
<div class="content">
<p class="centercol"> This experiment can be completed by anyone who knows English. </p>
<p class="centercol"> <a href=https://farm.pcibex.net/p/OiCLVO/> Experiment 1 </a> </p>
</div>
</center>

<center><button class="collapsible">Experiment 2</button>
<div class="content">

<p class="centercol"> This experiment can only really be completed if you can read Chinese, but you can try it even if you don't know Chinese. You can do it using either a Traditional Chinese version, or aSimplified Chinese version, just choose the version that uses the type of Chinese characters you are most comfortable reading. </p>
<p class="centercol"> <a href=https://farm.pcibex.net/p/REsHlv/> Experiment 2 (traditional characters)</a> </p>
<p class="centercol"> <a href=https://farm.pcibex.net/p/fkRCbm/> Experiment 2 (simplified characters)</a> </p>
</div>
</center>



<p class="centercol">Both of the mini-experiments you did were priming experiments. For the first experiment, here are a few questions for you</p>

<p class="centercol">some text</p>


<center><button class="collapsible">Calculate your results</button>

<div class="content">
<p>Go back to the results you recorded when you did the experiment. You should have 28 responses (all either &quot;ba&quot; or &quot;pa&quot;.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Items number 3, 6, 12, and 26 were recordings with 0 ms of VOT.</li>
	<li>Items number 9, 14, 23, and 28 were recordings with 10 ms of VOT.</li>
	<li>Items number 19, 20, 21, and 24 were recordings with 20 ms of VOT.</li>
	<li>Items number 1, 7, 10, and 15 were recordings with 30 ms of VOT.</li>
	<li>Items number 2, 11, 25, and 27 were recordings with 40 ms of VOT.</li>
	<li>Items number 5, 13, 17, and 18 were recordings with 50 ms of VOT.</li>
	<li>Items number 4, 8, 16, and 22 were recordings with 60 ms of VOT.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each VOT, count how many times you wrote &quot;pa&quot;. For example, for 30 ms, check #1, #7, #10, and #15. If you wrote &quot;pa&quot; for #7 and &quot;ba&quot; for the other three, then your answer is &quot;1&quot; (you wrote &quot;pa&quot; one time for the 30-ms tokens.</p>

<p>Then, convert these responses into percentage (out of 4). 0 out of 4 is 0%; 1 out of 4 is 25%; 2 out of 4 is 50%; 3 out of 4 is 75%; and 4 out of 4 is 100%.</p>

<p>When you&#39;ve finished analyzing your results, you should put them into our&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cksK0IdlRmg-FnXlo88acLMZYzr4SqlH3LBZapbUDKc/edit?usp=sharing">shared Google spreadsheet</a>.&nbsp;After other people have completed this task, you can compare your results to theirs.</p>

<p>Finally, answer the question: <strong>Did your results match the prediction we described before? If your results were different than the prediction, describe how they are different.</strong></p>

<p class="centercol">When you have finished these activities, continue to the next section of the module: &quot;<a href="the-concept-of-categorical-perception.html">The concept of categorical perception</a>&quot;.</p>
