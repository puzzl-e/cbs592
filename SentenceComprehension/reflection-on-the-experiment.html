<h2>Reflection on the experiment (1.5 hours)</h2>

<p class="centercol"><a href="index.html">&crarr; Back to module homepage</a></p>

<p class="centercol">The previous experiment was about something called the <strong>garden path effect</strong>. Let&#39;s take a minute to look at the sentences from the test and figure out what the garden path effect is. Complete the activities below to learn about the garden path effect.</p>

<center><button class="collapsible">The stimuli from the experiment</button>

<div class="content">
<p>The important sentences in this experiment followed two different formats. Here are some examples:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The professional agent knew that the actress was arriving tomorrow.</li>
	<li>The professional agent knew the actress was arriving tomorrow.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What do you think is the key difference between sentence 1 and sentence 2?</strong> Explain both what the <em>linguistic</em> difference is (i.e., at the word and grammar level, what difference do you see between these sentences), and what the&nbsp;<em>psychological</em> difference might be (i.e., what might happen differently in people&#39;s mind when they read sentence 2, versus when they read sentence 1).</p>

<p>There is no right or wrong answer for now, and your response to this question is not graded. I just want you to think about what the difference might be before you continue on.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">The garden path effect</button>

<div class="content">

<p>Recall that the experiment included two kinds of sentences:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The professional agent knew that the actress was arriving tomorrow morning.</li>
	<li>The professional agent knew the actress was arriving tomorrow morning.</li>
</ol>

<p>The key difference between these is whether they include the connective (also called a <em>complementizer</em>) word, &quot;that&quot;.</p>

<p>Sentence #1 we often call the &quot;full&quot; form, because it has the subordinate clause ???) including &quot;that&quot;. Sentence #2 we often call the &quot;reduced&quot; form, because &quot;that&quot; is missing. So we could list the sentences like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Full</strong>: The professional agent knew that the actress was arriving tomorrow morning.</li>
	<li><strong>Reduced</strong>: The professional agent knew the actress was arriving tomorrow morning.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that when a person reads a sentence, they don&#39;t see the whole sentence at once; they see one word at a time (approximately) before their eyes move to the next word.</p>

<p>This means that when someone reads the reduced version of the sentence, there is a moment where they are reading <em>The professional agent knew the actress</em>...</p>

<p>When you read <em>The professional agent knew the actress</em>, you might think the <em>actress</em> is the object (賓語) of <em>knew</em>. In other words, the person that the agent knew was the actress. And then you might think the sentence is over (after all, &quot;The professional agent knew the actress&quot; could be a complete sentence). What would happen next?</p>

<p>If you think that the actress is the person that the agent knew, and the sentence is over, then when you suddenly read <em>was</em> (<em>The professional agent knew the actress was...</em>), you might get confused. You probably thought the sentence was over, so you will be surprised to see another word. And you might have to re-interpret the sentence in order to figure out what it means. You will have to realize the sentence is not actually saying that the agent knew the actress; rather, the thing the agent knows is the fact that the actress will arrive tomorrow morning. (Maybe the agent has never met the actress and doesn&#39;t know her.)</p>

<p>On the other hand, none of that stuff will happen when reading the full version of the sentence. When you read <em>The professional agent knew that the actress</em>..., you know that &quot;the actress&quot; is not the object of the verb (it can&#39;t be, because of the &quot;that&quot; there). And you know the sentence is not over yet, because <em>The professional agent knew that the actress...</em> is not a complete sentence.</p>

<p>We can think about this via a metaphor. When you are reading the reduced version of the sentence and you read <em>The professional agent knew the actress</em>, there are two ways you can understand the sentence: you can decide that the actress is the person who the agent knows, or you can decide that the sentence is not complete yet (i.e., decide that &quot;actress&quot; is the subject of a subordinate clause/ ??). It&#39;s kind of like you&#39;re walking in a beautiful garden and the path splits two ways, and you need to choose which way to go: you can follow one path (the path where you interpret &quot;actress&quot; as the object of &quot;knew&quot;), or you can follow the other path (the path where you interpret &quot;actress&quot; as the subject of a subordinate clause). You might be tempted to take the first path (where &quot;actress&quot; looks like the object of &quot;knew&quot;), because that&#39;s the simpler and more common way to interpret the sentence. But after you take a few steps down this path, you might read the next word (&quot;was&quot;) and realize that you took the wrong path! You will be like, &quot;Oops!&quot;, and need to turn around and go back to the right path.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why this kind of research design is called the <em>garden path effect</em>. It&#39;s a way to measure what you do when you initially mis-understand a sentence (i.e., you think it means one thing) and then you realize your understanding was wrong, and you have to go back and change the way you understood it.</p>

<p>Remember that I predicted you might get surprised when you read <em>was</em> in the reduced version of the sentence, but not the full version. The <strong>garden path effect</strong> is based on the comparison between these. I want to compare how long it took you to read <em>was</em> in the reduced version, versus how long it took you to read <em>was</em> in the full version. If you took much longer to read <em>was</em> in the reduced version than it took you to read the exact same word in the full version, we say that&#39;s a garden path effect.</p>

<p>(Note that an &quot;effect&quot; is always based on comparing two different numbers! Remember when we talked about priming: the &quot;priming effect&quot; happens when responses to related targets are slower than responses to unrelated targets. Likewise, the &quot;garden path effect&quot; happens when people read the critical word in the reduced sentence more slowly than they read the critical word in the full sentence.)</p>

<p>We are able to measure how long it took you to read each word in the sentence in this experiment, because you pressed a button for each word. Therefore, the amount of time from when you pressed the button to see a word (like <em>was</em>) until the time you pressed the button to see the next word, is your <strong>reading time. </strong>This experiment method is called <strong>self-paced reading</strong>, because you read at your own pace. If you&#39;re interested in more information about self-paced reading, you can see the following article:</p>

<p>Now we finally reach the question.</p>

<p><strong>Draw a graph of what you expect the result of this experiment to look like.</strong></p>
