		<h3>What is plagiarism?</h3>

<p class="centercol">Several tasks in the modules require you to read (or browse) one or more psycholinguistics articles.</p>
<p class="centercol">Psycholinguistics articles are often complicated to read; most of them are written to be read by other psycholinguistics experts, and thus students like you are often not the intended
	audience. Don't feel back if you can't understand everything in the paper. As long as you can understand enough to answer the questions in the module, that will be enough. As you get more experience with
	these kinds of papers, they will gradually become easier to understand.</p>
<p class="centercol">The papers often have a lot of technical detail, which you don't always need to understand. Every time I assign a paper for you to read, I also give you some question you should be trying
	to address when you read that paper. Therefore, don't try to understand every word in every sentence of the paper; just focus on trying to find the information you need to answer the question.</p>
